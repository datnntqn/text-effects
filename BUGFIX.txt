BUG FIX - Privacy Crash Issue
================================

ISSUE: App crashed with "NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription" error

ROOT CAUSE: Missing privacy usage descriptions in Info.plist

SOLUTION: Added privacy keys to project.pbxproj
- INFOPLIST_KEY_NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription
- INFOPLIST_KEY_NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription

STATUS: ✅ FIXED

Build: SUCCESS
Install: SUCCESS
App should now run without privacy crashes

OTHER WARNINGS (Non-critical):
- eligibility.plist: System file, can be ignored
- Layout constraints: iOS keyboard system warnings, harmless
- RTIInputSystemClient: System warning, doesn't affect functionality
